# bitget-group-trade-PENDAX
JS program built on PENDAX library that takes in a unified set of trade params and executes on multiple bitget accounts in an account size adjusted manner.

this is a demo program meant to be a rough manner of executing the same trade on multiple accounts that have different balance. This is using a "risk" multiplier where 1 = 100% equity of the account and 0 = 0% of the account equity.

use at your own risk and feel free to make changes as needed. Some parameters may need to be adjusted based on market being traded.
